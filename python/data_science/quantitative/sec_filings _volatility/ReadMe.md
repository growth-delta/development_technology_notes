# SEC filings & Stock Volatility


This notebook serves as the foundational structure for a Python project designed to backtest historical stock returns under the condition of a filed SEC financial form. The project aims to analyze financial data, leveraging the historical information provided by SEC filings and Yahoo finance, to assess and simulate investment returns, laying the groundwork for a comprehensive financial analysis tool.

## Getting Started



***Open vscode or IDE, then open the project folder in the terminal.***

`cd sec_filings_volatility`


***Now create a virtual environment in the project base called venv/***

`py -m venv venv`


***Activate venv from terminal.***

`/sec_filings _volatility/venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1`


***Install project python requirments***

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


Now you can run the program from inside the `sec_filings_volatility/notebook.ipynb` I am assuming you are using [MSFT visualstudio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and have python 3.11 installed.
